<h2>Objectives</h2>

The objective of this programming assignment is to have you 
practice implementing a new data structure and also to gain some
experience using the <tt>list</tt> template container class from 
the C++ Standard Template Library (STL).
 

<hr>
<h2>Introduction</h2> 

<p>
For this project, you will implement a <i>square list</i> data
structure. A square list is a linked list of linked lists where each
linked list is guaranteed to have 
<i>O</i>(&#8730;<span style="text-decoration:overline;font-style:italic;">n</span>) 
items:
</p>

<div style="border:1px solid grey;margin:2em 5em 2em 5em;">
<img align="center" src="./squarelists_files/Slide2.jpg">
<p align="center">
Fig. 1: A typical square list.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Figure 1 shows a typical square list of 25 integer values. The positions
of the items are important. The ordering of the items in this example
is: 3, 2, 5, 10, 21, 9, 32, 14, 41, 20, 23, ..., 15, 1, 11.
</p>

<p>
The idea of a square list is that we want to keep the length of the
top-level and of all the inner lists bounded by
<i>O</i>(&#8730;<span style="text-decoration:overline;font-style:italic;">n</span>).
That way we can find the <i>i</i><sup>th</sup> item of the list in
<i>O</i>(&#8730;<span style="text-decoration:overline;font-style:italic;">n</span>)
time. For example, if we want to find the 9th item in the list, we can
progress down the top-level list and check the length of the inner
lists. We know the 9th item cannot be in the first inner list, since it
only has 3 items. It also cannot be in the second inner list, since
the first two lists combined only has 6 items. Instead, we can find
the 9th item of the square list by looking for the 3rd item of the third
inner list, which turns out to be 41. 
</p>

<p>
To accomplish this search in 
<i>O</i>(&#8730;<span style="text-decoration:overline;font-style:italic;">n</span>)
time, we must be able to determine the length of each inner list in O(1) time.
In the worst case, we have to search through
<i>O</i>(&#8730;<span style="text-decoration:overline;font-style:italic;">n</span>)
items of the top-level list before we find the inner list
that holds the <i>i</i><sup>th</sup> item.
An additional
<i>O</i>(&#8730;<span style="text-decoration:overline;font-style:italic;">n</span>)
steps will allow us to find the desired item in that inner list,
since the length of each inner list is also
<i>O</i>(&#8730;<span style="text-decoration:overline;font-style:italic;">n</span>).
</p>

<p>
The main difficulty in maintaining a square list is that as we add items
to and remove items from a square list, the length of the inner lists can
change. This can happen in two ways. First, obviously, when we add items to or
remove items from an inner list, the length of that inner list changes.
Secondly, the length of an inner list relative to 
<i>O</i>(&#8730;<span style="text-decoration:overline;font-style:italic;">n</span>)
can also change when we add or remove items elsewhere in the square list
because doing so changes the value of <i>n</i>. For example, the 5th inner list in
Figure&nbsp;1 has 5 items. This happens to be exactly 
&#8730;<span style="text-decoration:overline;">25</span>.
If we removed all 10 items from the first 3 inner lists, that would
leave us with only 15 items in the entire square list. 
<span style="color:orange;">
After the removals, the length of the last inner list becomes bigger than
&#8730;<span style="text-decoration:overline;">n</span> even
though the length of that list didn't change. The length becomes bigger
than &#8730;<span style="text-decoration:overline;">n</span> because 
&#8730;<span style="text-decoration:overline;">n</span> dropped from
&#8730;<span style="text-decoration:overline;">25</span>
to
&#8730;<span style="text-decoration:overline;">15</span>,
and 5 &gt; &#8730;<span style="text-decoration:overline;">15</span>.
</span>
</p>

<h2>Square List Maintenance</h2>

<p>
Our goal is to make sure that the top-level list and all the inner lists
have lengths bounded by
<i>O</i>(&#8730;<span style="text-decoration:overline;font-style:italic;">n</span>).
It is too expensive to require that our square list always has
&#8730;<span style="text-decoration:overline;font-style:italic;">n</span>
inner lists, each with 
&#8730;<span style="text-decoration:overline;font-style:italic;">n</span>
items. Instead, we maintain the following two conditions:
</p><dl>
<dt>Condition 1:</dt>
<dd> Every inner list has &#8804; 
2 &#8730;<span style="text-decoration:overline;font-style:italic;">n</span> 
items.
</dd>
<dt>Condition 2:</dt>
<dd> There are no adjacent short inner lists, where <i>short</i> is
defined as having 
&#8804; &#8730;<span style="text-decoration:overline;font-style:italic;">n</span>/2
items.
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Notice that neither condition says anything about the length of the
top-level list. Instead, we claim that if Condition&nbsp;2 holds,
then the top-level list cannot have more than
4 &#8730;<span style="text-decoration:overline;font-style:italic;">n</span>
items. Too see this, suppose the contrary. That is, suppose that the
top-level list has more than
4 &#8730;<span style="text-decoration:overline;font-style:italic;">n</span>
items. (Yes, this is the beginning of a proof by contradiction.)
Then, there must be more than 
2&nbsp;&#8730;<span style="text-decoration:overline;font-style:italic;">n</span>
inner lists that are not short (otherwise, two of the short inner lists
would be adjacent). Thus, the total number of items in these non-short
lists must exceed
2 &#8730;<span style="text-decoration:overline;font-style:italic;">n</span>
× 
&#8730;<span style="text-decoration:overline;font-style:italic;">n</span>/2
= <i>n</i>. This is a contradiction because n <i>is</i> the number of items
(by definition) and cannot exceed itself.
Therefore, the number of inner lists (and thus the length of the
top-level list) must be bounded by 
4&nbsp;&#8730;<span style="text-decoration:overline;font-style:italic;">n</span>.
</p>

<p>
These observations allow us to maintain the 
<i>O</i>(&#8730;<span style="text-decoration:overline;font-style:italic;">n</span>)
bounds on the lengths of the top-level list and the inner lists using
the following procedure:

</p><div style="border:1px solid grey;margin:1em 3em;padding:1em 3em;">
<h3>Consolidate:</h3>
<ol>
   <li> Traverse the top-level list.
   </li><li> Whenever an empty inner list is encountered, remove that inner list.
   </li><li> Whenever two adjacent short inner lists are encountered,
        merge them into a single inner list. (See Figures&nbsp;2
        and&nbsp;3.)
   </li><li> Whenever an inner list is found to have more than
        2 &#8730;<span style="text-decoration:overline;font-style:italic;">n</span>
        items, split them into two lists of equal length.
        (See Figure&nbsp;4.)
</li></ol>
</div>
<br>

<p>
Some notes on the Consolidate procedure: 
</p>
<ul>
<p></p><li> Our strategy for this project is to run Consolidate after every
operation that adds an item to or removes an item from the square list.
(This is a simplification. See <a href="https://userpages.umbc.edu/~chang/cs341.f17/projects/proj2addendum.shtml">Addendum</a> 
for a longer explanation.)

<p></p></li><li> When two short lists are merged into one, the order of the items in the
square list must not change. In Figure&nbsp;2, the original
order of the items in the short lists where 10, 21, 32, 14.
In Figure&nbsp;3, the order of the items in the merged list is the same.

<p></p></li><li> We need the data structure for the inner list to support
a merge operation in constant time. A singly linked list with
a tail pointer would work.

<p></p></li><li> In Figure&nbsp;4, the inner list that is too long has an even number
of items. If a long list has an odd number of items, then after the
split, one list will have one more item than the other. This does
not affect the asymptotic running time.

<p></p></li><li> When a long list is split, the order of the items must be
preserved. (See Figure&nbsp;4.)

<p></p></li><li> Without any splits, the total running time for the Consolidate 
procedure is 
<i>O</i>(&#8730;<span style="text-decoration:overline;font-style:italic;">n</span>),
because we can merge short lists in constant time.

<p></p></li><li> The split step can be costly because it takes <i>O(t)</i> time
to split an inner list in half, where <i>t</i> is the length of the
inner list.  We can show using <i>amortized analysis</i> that splits do not
happen very often. The proof is not hard but is beyond the scope of this
course. The amortized analysis gives an <i>amortized</i> running time
of 
<i>O</i>(&#8730;<span style="text-decoration:overline;font-style:italic;">n</span>)
for most of the list operations (except <tt>indexOf</tt>). The amortized analysis
shows that any mix of <i>m</i> list operations (not including <tt>indexOf</tt>) 
will take a total running time of 
<i>O</i>(<i>m</i>&#8730;<span style="text-decoration:overline;font-style:italic;">n</span>).
Thus, the <i>amortized</i> time for each of the <i>m</i> square list operations is 
<i>O</i>(&#8730;<span style="text-decoration:overline;font-style:italic;">n</span>).
Although, it is tempting to think of the amortized running time as an
"average" running time, this is not accurate because the amortized
analysis does not depend on the sequence of operations being "nice" or
"average" in any way. Even when an adversary chooses the nastiest sequence of
operations which results in the maximum number of splits,  the total
running time for that sequence of <i>m</i> operations will still be bounded by
<i>O</i>(<i>m</i>&#8730;<span style="text-decoration:overline;font-style:italic;">n</span>).

<h2>Assignment</h2>

<p>
<i>Note: Running time is one of the most important considerations in
the implementation of a data structure. Programs that produce the
desired output but exceed the required running times are considered
<i>wrong</i> implementations and will receive substantial deductions
during grading.</i>
</p>


<p>
Your assignment is to implement a square list data structure as described
above that hold integer values (more on "integer" later).
Both the top-level list and the inner lists should be implemented
using the C++ STL <tt>list</tt> templated container class.
</p>

<p>
This assignment specifies the interface between the main program and
your square list implementation, but you are free to design the class
as you wish, subject to some requirements below.
In particular, you are not provided with a header file for the square
list class.
Note that design is part of the grading
criteria, so you do need to apply good design principles to your
inner list data structure.
</p>

<p>
<b>Requirement:</b> Your square list class must be called
<tt>SqList</tt>. The class definition must be placed in a file
called <tt>SqList.h</tt> and the member functions must be implemented
in a file called <tt>SqList.cpp</tt>. File names are case-sensitive
on GL.
</p>

<p>
<b>Requirement:</b> Your square list class must store the square list
in a list of lists. Your <tt>SqList</tt> class definition must have
the declaration:
</p><xmp>   list< list<Int341> > L ;
</xmp>
We are omitting the traditional <tt>m_</tt> before this data member's
name because you will type its name so often. More on <tt>Int341</tt> below.
<p></p>

<p>
<b>Requirement:</b> You are given the class definition and
implementation of the
<tt>Int341</tt> class in 
<a href="https://userpages.umbc.edu/~chang/cs341.f17/projects/proj2files/Int341.h"><tt>Int341.h</tt></a>
and
<a href="https://userpages.umbc.edu/~chang/cs341.f17/projects/proj2files/Int341.cpp"><tt>Int341.cpp</tt></a>.
You may not change these files in any way.
</p>

<p>
<b>Requirement:</b> You must have a member function named
<tt>consolidate</tt> with the following signature in your
<tt>SqList</tt>
</p><xmp>   void consolidate() ;
</xmp>
You must place your code for the consolidate process described above
in this function. (This is so the graders can find where you implement
the consolidate process.)
<b><i>
The consolidate function must not directly or indirectly invoke 
the constructor, copy constructor or the assignment operator of the 
<tt>Int341</tt> class.
</i></b>
This member function should run in 
<i>O</i>(&#8730;<span style="text-decoration:overline;font-style:italic;">n</span>)
time not counting splits. The splits should take time proportional
to the length of the inner list that is split.
<p></p>

<p>
<b>Requirement:</b> You must have a <i>public</i> member function named
<tt>inspector</tt> with the following signature in your
<tt>SqList</tt> class definition:
</p><xmp>   void inspector() ;
</xmp>
This member function will be implemented by the grading programs, so
you should <i>not</i> implement <tt>inspector()</tt>. It must be public
so it can be called by the grading programs. Since <tt>inspector()</tt>
is a member function, it will have access to <tt>SqList</tt> data
members, in particular, it has access to <tt>L</tt>.
<p></p>

<p>
<b>Requirement:</b> 
Your code must not have any memory leaks. When you run your code
under <tt>valgrind</tt> on GL, it must report:
</p><xmp>   All heap blocks were freed -- no leaks are possible
</xmp>
<p></p>

<p>
<b>Requirement:</b> 
Your implementation must be <i>efficient</i>. The running time for
<i>n</i> operations with <i>n</i> data items stored in the
<tt>SqList</tt> must be 
<i>O</i>(<i>n</i> &#8730;<span style="text-decoration:overline;font-style:italic;">n</span>).
(See "How to Submit" below.)
</p>

<br>
<hr>
<h2>Specifications</h2>

In addition to the requirements above, your <tt>SqList</tt> class must
have the following member functions with the specified function
signatures and running times:


<p></p><li> A default constructor that initializes a <tt>SqList</tt>
properly. It should run in O(1) time.

<p></p></li><li> A copy constructor with the signature
<xmp class="code">   SqList(const SqList& other) ;
</xmp>
The running time of the copy constructor must be <i>O(n)</i>. (I.e.,
copy, do not insert <i>n</i> times.)

<p></p></li><li> An overloaded assignment operator with the signature
<xmp class="code">   const SqList& operator=(const SqList& rhs) ;
</xmp>
The running time of the assignment operator must be <i>O(n)</i>. 

<p></p></li><li> A destructor may or may not be required. This depends on your
design. In any case, your implementation must not leak memory.

<p></p></li><li> A member function <tt>consolidate()</tt> as described above.

<p></p></li><li> Two member functions to insert at the beginning and at the end  of 
a <tt>SqList</tt> with the following signatures:
<p></p><xmp class="code">   void addFirst (const Int341& x) ;
   void addLast (const Int341& x) ;
</xmp><p></p>
These member functions should call <tt>consolidate()</tt> after insertion.
They must run in constant time, not counting the time for 
<tt>consolidate()</tt>.

<p></p></li><li> Two member functions to remove an item at the beginning 
and at the end of a <tt>SqList</tt> with the following signatures:
<p></p><xmp class="code">   Int341 removeFirst ()  ;
   Int341 removeLast ()  ;
</xmp><p></p>
These functions must return the <tt>Int341</tt> value that was stored at the
beginning and the end of the list. If the list is empty, then they
should throw an <tt>out_of_range</tt> exception.
These member functions should call <tt>consolidate()</tt> after removal.
They should run in constant time, not counting the time for <tt>consolidate()</tt>.

<p></p></li><li> A member function to insert an item at a given position of a <tt>SqList</tt>.
<p></p><xmp class="code">   void add(int pos, const Int341& data) ;
</xmp><p></p>
Positions start at 0. Thus, <tt>add(0,Int341(5))</tt> should
insert 5 at the beginning of the list. Also, if a square list
originally held 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, then after <tt>add(2,99)</tt> the 
list should hold 1, 2, 99, 3, 4, 5.
<span style="color:orange;">
If <tt>pos</tt> equals the number of items in the <tt>SqList</tt>,
then <tt>data</tt> should be added to the end of the list.
</span>
If <tt>pos</tt> is not valid, throw an <tt>out_of_range</tt> exception.
This function should call <tt>consolidate()</tt> after insertion.
The <tt>add()</tt> function should take time
<i>O</i>(&#8730;<span style="text-decoration:overline;font-style:italic;">n</span>)
not counting the time for <tt>consolidate()</tt>.

<p></p></li><li> A member function to remove an item from a given position of a <tt>SqList</tt>
and return its value.
<p></p><xmp class="code">   Int341 remove(int pos) ;
</xmp><p></p>
As with <tt>add()</tt>, positions start at 0.  So, if a square list
originally held 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, then after <tt>remove(3)</tt> the 
list should hold 1, 2, 3, 5.
If <tt>pos</tt> is not valid, throw an <tt>out_of_range</tt> exception.
This function should call <tt>consolidate()</tt> after removal.
The <tt>remove()</tt> function should take time
<i>O</i>(&#8730;<span style="text-decoration:overline;font-style:italic;">n</span>)
not counting the time for <tt>consolidate()</tt>.

<p></p></li><li> An overloaded <tt>[]</tt> operator.
<p></p><xmp class="code">   Int341& operator[](int pos) ;
</xmp><p></p>
As with <tt>add()</tt>, positions start at 0.  So, if a <tt>SqList S</tt>
originally held 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, then <tt>S[2]</tt> should return 3.
Since a reference is returned, this <tt>[]</tt> can also be used to 
modify the <tt>SqList</tt>. For example,
<xmp>   S[2] = Int341(777) ;
</xmp>
should make the list 1, 2, 777, 4, 5.
If <tt>pos</tt> is not valid, throw an <tt>out_of_range</tt> exception.
The <tt>[]</tt> operator should take time
<i>O</i>(&#8730;<span style="text-decoration:overline;font-style:italic;">n</span>).

<p></p></li><li> A member function that returns the position of the first occurrence of a 
value in a <tt>SqList</tt>.
<p></p><xmp class="code">   int indexOf(const Int341& data) ;
</xmp><p></p>
If <tt>data</tt> does not appear in the list, then return -1.
As with <tt>add()</tt>, positions start at 0.  So, if a square list
originally held 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, then <tt>indexOf(5)</tt> 
should return 4.
The <tt>indexOf()</tt> function should run in <i>O</i>(<i>n</i>) time.

<p></p></li><li> A member function that returns the number of items in a <tt>SqList</tt>.
<p></p><xmp class="code">   int numItems() ; 
</xmp><p></p>
The <tt>numItems()</tt> function should run in constant time. This is used
in grading.

<p></p></li><li> A debugging member function:
<p></p><xmp class="code">   void dump() ; 
</xmp><p></p>
The <tt>dump()</tt> member function should print out 
the number of items in the
<tt>SqList</tt> and for each inner list, the size of
the inner list, each item in the inner list.
(See sample output for recommended format.)
The running time of <tt>dump()</tt> does not matter since it
is used for debugging purposes only. 
However, you should
implement <tt>dump()</tt> in the most reliable manner possible
(i.e., avoid calls to member functions which might themselves be buggy).

<p></p></li><li> The member function <tt>inspector()</tt> as described above.
<p></p><xmp class="code">   void inspector() ; 
</xmp><p></p>

<h2>Implementation Notes</h2> 

<p>
Before we list some recommendations and point out some traps and
pitfalls, let's discuss <tt>Int341</tt> and why we have it.
One of the pitfalls of using STL container classes (and
object-oriented programming in general) is unintentional copying.
The <tt>Int341</tt> class has just an <tt>int</tt> for its payload data.
Its purpose is to allow us to track the number of times that 
the constructor, copy constructor, destructor and assignment operators
are called. Consider the following main program that uses 5 different
methods for retrieving the last item of a <tt>list&lt;Int341&gt;</tt>
list. The <tt>report()</tt> member function of <tt>Int341</tt> prints

<p>
The main point here is that your <tt>consolidate()</tt> function should
not copy any data items. In particular, when you split and merge inner
lists, you should not increase the number of calls to the
<tt>Int341</tt> constructor, copy constructor, destructor or assignment
operator. You can check this by calling <tt>Int341::report()</tt> before
and after you call consolidate.
</p>

<p>
Now we list some recommendations and point out some traps and
pitfalls:
</p>

<ul>

<p></p><li> Apply the incremental programming methodology. Implement one or
two member functions and <i>fully debug</i> them before writing more
code. 

<p></p></li><li> Carefully study the documentation for the STL <tt>list</tt>
container class (e.g., 
<a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/list/list/">here</a>).
Pay attention to the parameters, return values and the effect
that a call would have on iterators. 
Make sure that you understand <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/iterator/">
iterators</a> and how to use them.
There are often several ways to 
do the same thing with these member functions. You should choose the
option that is more efficient and avoids copying.

<p></p></li><li> Do look at the 
<a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/list/list/splice/">splice</a>
member function for the <tt>list</tt> class.

<p></p></li><li> If you are not sure what a <tt>list</tt> member function does,
write a small program that uses the function to test it.

<p></p></li><li> Review what the <tt>list</tt> destructor does and when it is
invoked.

<p></p></li><li> The <tt>consolidate()</tt> function is the hardest. Think
through the logic carefully before you code. For example, it is possible
to have 3 short inner lists in a row. (How?) Would your
<tt>consolidate()</tt> handle this case correctly? What are some other
"weird" cases?

</li></ul>

<h2>Testing</h2>

<p>
In <a href="https://userpages.umbc.edu/~chang/cs341.f17/projects/proj1.shtml">Project 1</a>, you were given an extensive
suite of test programs. This is to provide you with an example of how
you can test your code. For this project, you will have to write your
own test program. The test program we provide below is just to make sure
that your code will compile with the grading programs. Rest assured that
the grading programs will exercise your code vigorously.
</p>

<p>Test programs: </p>
<ul>
  <p></p><li> Program that uses every required member function in the
  <tt>SqList</tt> class. This includes an implementation of
  <tt>inspector()</tt> that checks that your inner lists are not too
  long and do not have adjacent short lists.

<h2>How to Submit</h2>

<p> 
You only need to submit two files: <tt>SqList.cpp</tt> and <tt>SqList.h</tt>.
If for some reason you want to define new classes and additonal
functions, put all the declarations in <tt>SqList.h</tt> and all the
implementations in <tt>SqList.cpp</tt>.
</p>

<p>
Do not submit <tt>Int341.h</tt> or <tt>Int341.cpp</tt> since those
should not have changed.
</p>

<p>
If you followed the instructions in the 
<a href="https://userpages.umbc.edu/~chang/cs341.f17/projects/submission.shtml">Project Submission</a> 
page to set up your directories, you can submit your code using 
this Unix command:
</p>
<p></p><xmp>   cp SqList.h SqList.cpp ~/cs341proj/proj2/
</xmp>
<p></p>
Use the Unix script command to show that your code compiles. Also run <tt>valgrind</tt> on <tt>p2comptest.cpp</tt>
and time the 3 timing programs.
<p></p>
<p></p><xmp style="border: 2px solid #e1e1e1; padding:10px 20px; font-size:80%;">linux3% cd ~/cs341proj/proj2/

Script done, file is typescript
</xmp><p></p>

<p>
Do remember to exit from the script command. This creates a file called <tt>typescript</tt>
that will record any compilation errors. Yes, we know you can edit this file, but the
compilation errors will just show up when we compile the programs again
and you will still get lots of points deducted. This step is to
compel you to fix any changes needed to get your program to compile on
GL without any errors.
</p>

<p>
<i>Note:</i> <tt>cd</tt> to the appropriate directory if you are submitting late.
</p>

<p>
Now you can delete the executable files with
</p>
<p></p><xmp>   rm t?.out
</xmp><p></p>

<p>
Then you should just have 3 files in your submission directory. Check
using the <tt>ls</tt> command. You can also double check that you
are in the correct directory using the <tt>pwd</tt> command. (You should
see your username instead of <tt>xxxxx</tt>.)

<h2>A Note on Timing</h2>

<p>
The main programs for timing above 
( <a href="https://userpages.umbc.edu/~chang/cs341.f17/projects/proj2files/p2timetest1.cpp"><tt>p2timetest1.cpp</tt></a>,
<a href="https://userpages.umbc.edu/~chang/cs341.f17/projects/proj2files/p2timetest2.cpp"><tt>p2timetest2.cpp</tt></a> and
<a href="https://userpages.umbc.edu/~chang/cs341.f17/projects/proj2files/p2timetest3.cpp"><tt>p2timetest3.cpp</tt></a>)
double the number of items and the number of calls to <tt>SqList</tt> 
member functions each time. Since we expect the total running time to
be
<i>O</i>(<i>n</i> &#8730;<span style="text-decoration:overline;font-style:italic;">n</span>),
doubling the value of <i>n</i> should increase the total running time by
a factor of approximately 2.82. This is because
</p>
<blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<i>2n</i> &#8730;<span style="text-decoration:overline;font-style:italic;"> 2n</span>
=
<i>2</i> &#8730;<span style="text-decoration:overline;font-style:italic;">2</span>
<i>n</i> &#8730;<span style="text-decoration:overline;font-style:italic;">n</span>

<br><br>
</blockquote>
<p>
and 
<i>2</i> &#8730;<span style="text-decoration:overline;font-style:italic;">2</span>
&#8776; 2.82. On some systems (e.g., Mac OS X), the running times bear
this out:
</p>
<p>
</p><xmp class="code">MyMacBook% time ./t1.out
0.978u 0.002s 0:00.98 98.9%	0+0k 0+0io 0pf+0w
MyMacBook% time ./t2.out
2.814u 0.003s 0:02.81 100.0%	0+0k 0+0io 0pf+0w
MyMacBook% time ./t3.out
8.201u 0.007s 0:08.20 100.0%	0+0k 0+0io 0pf+0w
</xmp><p></p>
<p>
The ratios 2.814/0.978 &#8776; 2.877 and 8.201/2.814 &#8776; 2.914 are
quite close to the predicted value of 2.82.
</p>

<p>
<b>However</b>, it turns out that the Standard Template Library is not
so standard. (See <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/manual/containers.html#sequences.list.size">
note on GNU website</a>.)
In particular the running time of the <tt>size()</tt>
function may be <i>O</i>(1), which is what we want, or
<i>O</i>(<i>n</i>), which is what is on GL. So, timing the same programs
on GL gives quadratic running time.
</p>
<p>
</p><xmp class="code">linux3% time t1.out
0.292u 0.000s 0:00.29 100.0%    0+0k 0+0io 0pf+0w
linux3% time t2.out
1.122u 0.000s 0:01.12 100.0%    0+0k 0+0io 0pf+0w
linux3% time t3.out
4.248u 0.000s 0:04.25 99.7%     0+0k 0+0io 0pf+0w
</xmp><p></p>
<p>
Each successive run gives roughly quadruples the running time:
1.122/0.292 &#8776; 3.84 and 4.248/1.122 &#8776; 3.786.
Your implementation should assume that <tt>size()</tt> takes <i>O</i>(1)
time.

<h2>Discussion Topics</h2>

Here are some topics to think about to help you understand square lists.
You can discuss these topics with other students without contradicting the
course <a href="https://userpages.umbc.edu/~chang/cs341.f17/projects/academic-conduct.shtml">Academic Conduct Policy</a>.

<ol>
<p></p><li> Suppose you start with an empty square list and keep inserting items
in the front of the list. When does the first merge occur?

<p></p></li><li> What is the smallest number of items you can have in a square
list that has 11 inner lists?

<p></p></li><li> Do we ever encounter long inner lists that have to be split
(other than the first inner list)  if we only allowed insertion and
removal at the beginning of the list?

<p></p></li><li> After you split an inner list, is it possible that the same
inner list has to be split again after the very next square list
operation? after two operations? when could the next split occur?

<p></p></li><li> Can you ever encounter 3 short lists in a row during the
Consolidate procedure? Does it matter? and should you write code
whose correctness depends on the answer to these questions?
